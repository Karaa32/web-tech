    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <p>1. Why is humanity focused on exploring and living in space?
Space exploration helps us advance science, develop new technologies, protect our planet, and secure the long-term survival of our species. It also opens the door to discovering new resources and understanding our place in the universe.</p>

<p>2. How do rockets launch spacecraft into space?
Rockets use powerful engines that burn fuel rapidly, producing thrust strong enough to lift the spacecraft off the ground and push it beyond Earth’s atmosphere. Most rockets use multiple stages, dropping empty components to become lighter as they climb.</p>

<p>3. What challenges do humans face when living in space?
Astronauts must deal with microgravity, radiation exposure, limited resources, and psychological challenges from isolation. Life-support systems, shielding, and careful mission planning help reduce these risks.</p>

<p>4. How long does it take to reach space?
It takes only about 8–10 minutes for a spacecraft to reach low Earth orbit. Traveling to the Moon takes roughly three days, while a journey to Mars can take six to nine months depending on orbital alignment.</p>
