    <h2>Launch and Landing</h2>
    <p>The journey into space begins long before a spacecraft leaves the ground. Every launch is a precisely timed sequence of engineering, physics, and coordination, designed to propel a vehicle from Earth’s surface into orbit or beyond. Modern launch systems use powerful multi-stage rockets, shedding weight as they climb through the atmosphere to achieve the speed needed for spaceflight. But getting there is only half the mission—returning safely is just as critical. Advanced heat shields protect the spacecraft as it reenters Earth’s atmosphere, while parachutes, retro-rockets, or powered landings ensure a controlled descent. Whether touching down on a distant planet or gliding back to Earth, each landing represents a triumph of precision, preparation, and innovation. Together, these launch and landing processes form the backbone of every successful mission, carrying humanity further into the cosmos and bringing our explorers safely home.</p>
